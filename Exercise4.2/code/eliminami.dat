Classic Lennard-Jones fluid
Molecular dynamics simulation in NVE ensemble  

Interatomic potential v(r) = 4 * [(1/r)^12 - (1/r)^6]

The program uses Lennard-Jones units 
Number of particles = 108
Density of particles = 0.8
Volume of the simulation box = 135
Edge of the simulation box = 5.12993
The program integrates Newton equations with the Verlet method 
Time step = 0.0005
Number of steps = 1000

Read initial configuration from file config.0
